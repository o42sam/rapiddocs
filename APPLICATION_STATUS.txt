====================================
Date: January 15, 2025

✅ APPLICATION IS RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY

BACKEND STATUS:
---------------
Server: Running on http://localhost:8000
Health: OPERATIONAL
Architecture: Clean Architecture v2.0.0
API Docs: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs

Available Endpoints:
- /health - Health check ✅ Working
- /api/v1/status - API status ✅ Working
- /api/v1/docs - API documentation
- /api/v1/invoice/generate - Placeholder (needs implementation)
- /api/v1/infographic/generate - Placeholder (needs implementation)
- /api/v1/formal/generate - Placeholder (needs implementation)

FRONTEND STATUS:
----------------
Server: Running on http://localhost:5173
Status: OPERATIONAL
Development Mode: Vite dev server

ARCHITECTURE STATUS:
--------------------
Domain Layer: ✅ Complete
- All interfaces defined
- Value objects created
- Entities implemented
- Domain exceptions ready

Application Layer: 🔄 Partial
- DTOs complete
- 1 of 5 use cases implemented
- Needs remaining use cases

Infrastructure Layer: 📦 Structure Ready
- Directory structure created
- Needs service implementations

Presentation Layer: 🔄 Minimal
- Temporary endpoints created
- Needs full route implementation

NEXT STEPS FOR FULL FUNCTIONALITY:
-----------------------------------
1. Complete remaining use cases in application layer
2. Implement infrastructure services (text generation, image generation, etc.)
3. Wire up dependency injection in main.py
4. Create presentation layer routes
5. Connect frontend to new API endpoints

CURRENT STATE:
--------------
The application is running in a minimal state with:
- Clean Architecture foundation in place
- Backend serving placeholder API endpoints
- Frontend running and able to connect to backend
- Health checks passing

The system is operational but document generation features are not yet functional
due to the ongoing Clean Architecture migration. The foundation is solid and ready
for the implementation of the remaining layers.
