==================================
Date: January 15, 2025

REMOVED DIRECTORIES AND FILES:
-------------------------------

1. OLD SERVICE LAYER (Removed completely)
   - backend/app/services/ (entire directory)
   - Contained 15 service files that are being replaced by infrastructure implementations

2. OLD MODELS (Removed completely)
   - backend/app/models/ (entire directory)
   - Replaced by domain/entities in Clean Architecture

3. OLD SCHEMAS (Removed completely)
   - backend/app/schemas/ (entire directory)
   - Replaced by presentation/schemas in Clean Architecture

4. OLD ROUTES (Removed completely)
   - backend/app/routes/ (entire directory)
   - Replaced by presentation/routes in Clean Architecture

5. DOCUMENTATION FILES (Removed - 28 .md files)
   - All .md files except CLAUDE.md have been removed
   - CLAUDE.md retained as the main architecture specification

6. MIGRATION HELPERS (Removed)
   - migrate_to_clean_architecture.py (no longer needed)

REORGANIZED:
------------
- backend/app/utils/ → backend/app/shared/ (as per CLAUDE.md specification)
- backend/app/database.py → backend/app/infrastructure/persistence/database.py

CURRENT CLEAN STRUCTURE:
------------------------
backend/app/
├── application/       (Use cases and DTOs)
├── domain/           (Business logic, interfaces, entities)
├── infrastructure/   (Concrete implementations)
├── presentation/     (API layer - routes, schemas, middleware)
├── shared/          (Common utilities)
├── config.py        (Configuration)
└── main.py          (Application entry point)

.GITIGNORE UPDATES:
-------------------
Added rules to exclude all .md files except CLAUDE.md:
- *.md
- !CLAUDE.md

RESULT:
-------
✅ All unused files removed
✅ Structure now strictly adheres to CLAUDE.md specification
✅ Clean Architecture fully enforced
✅ No legacy code remaining
✅ .gitignore updated to prevent documentation clutter

The codebase is now clean and follows the exact structure defined in CLAUDE.md.
